This Python script is a small word-guessing game called "Single Use Words". 
The player attempts to guess words which are only ever used in the context of other words, hence Single Use.

For example, the word 'hissy', is exclusively followed by the word 'fit', 
so the player would get 100% for that submission.

The program searches a database of phrases and returns the top scoring words that match the player's search criteria. 

The player can also select how often groups of words appear. For example, given the word "muchness",
how often does the 3 word phrase "much of a" appear directly before it?

The answer is 97.9%!
